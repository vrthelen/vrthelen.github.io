                            <p>As someone pursuing the New Media Certificate currently, I think it's a great way to get introduced to the world of modern professionalism, the tech industry, marketing, or entertainment. The New Media Institute provides students with so many great opportunities to learn new skills and start various projects.</p>
                            <p></p>

                            <p class="mb-4">In Native App Development (NMIX 4310), I got to learn SwiftUI, a UI framework for building beautiful apps for iOS devices. Native App Development is great because it lets you study a very valuable skill if you're someone looking to get into the tech industry.</p>
                            <p>The hardest part of learning anything is often starting it - and this class gave me a great starting place! I intend to continue learning Swift on my own going forward, something I never would have known about or expected to do before taking this course.</p>

                            <p class="mb-4">In Advanced Web Production (NMIX 4020E), I was able to learn the basics of several important web development tools. These included HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other more specific tools such as Vue and Node.</p>
                            <p>Despite having pushed myself to learn these skills prior to taking NMIX 4020, my learning was stagnant without an actual course helping me along. But through assignments I was finally able to begin learning vital tools for web design.</p>

                            <p class="mb-4">In Digital Brown Bag (NMIX 4220), I was able to witness and listen to many amazing speakers brought in by the NMI. Each speaker had so much to say, from life and career advice to speaking on their experiences at different companies. We got to hear from employees at major corporations like Verizon and Twitter, as well as freelance workers and entrepreneurs. The class was a great introduction to many necessary life skills as well, such as how to handle credit cards, finances, and insurance. Many college students don't fully understand a lot of aspects about "the real world" and adult life and I think this class is a great way of introducing young adults into a professional environment.</p>
